Books for Binding
=================

This is a system of producing LaTeX-formatted books, ready for binding, from Wikisource works.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/samwilson/books-for-binding.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/samwilson/books-for-binding)

*It's a work-in-progress and not really ready for anyone to look at yet.*

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samwilson/books-for-binding.git
cd books-for-binding
composer install --no-dev
./bin/booksforbinding --help
```

## Usage

1. Select a work on a Wikisource.
2. Download the HTML of the book:
   ```bash
   ./bin/booksforbinding download -l en -t The_Nether_World -o directory/to/save-in
   ```
   This saves the HTML to a directory e.g. `directory/to/save-in/The_Nether_World/html`.
3. Convert the HTML to LaTeX:
   ```bash
   ./bin/booksforbinding convert -i directory/to/save-in/html
   ```
   This saves the LaTeX to a directory e.g. `directory/to/save-in/The_Nether_World/latex`.
4. Go into that directory and create a new Git repository with the contents therein:
   ```bash
   cd directory/to/save-in/The_Nether_World
   git init
   git add html latex
   git commit -am"First commit."
   git branch -m unchanged
   ```
   The idea is to have two branches: one for the unchanged source as it's generated by pandoc,
   and the other (the master) as the place to make edits.
   The former is merged into the latter whenever required.
5. Start editing the LaTeX files:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b master
   ```
6. Go back to the `unchanged` branch and update it, committing the changes.
7. Go to `master` and merge `unchanged`.
